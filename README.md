# BrainCapture Research Project
Here is the repository for the BrainCapture Research Project at the Technical University of Denmark.
The repository consists of three folders. In the Experiments folder is the description and code needed to reproduce the experiments along with the results. In the Data Analysis folder is the code used to analyse the data and generate visualization. This code is unorganized and uncommented. Lastly, in the PilotScript folder, the pilot scripts can be seen that was used to research before the main experiments.

## Data
In order to run the experiments, you need to download the TUH EEG Artifact Corpus, which is freely available at Temple University here: https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml

Afterwards, you need to run the preprocessing of the raw EEG files. In this project, we used the preprocessing made by David NyrnBerg which can be found here: https://github.com/DavidEnslevNyrnberg/DTU_DL_EEG

## Experiment: Sampling
In the sampling experiment folder, there is a single file experiment.py, that is needed to run the experiment.

## Experiment: Mixup

## Experiment: GAN

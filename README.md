# BrainCapture Research Project
Here is the repository for the BrainCapture Research Project at the Technical University of Denmark.
The repository consists of three folders. In the Experiments folder is the description and code needed to reproduce the experiments along with the results. In the Data Analysis folder is the code used to analyse the data and generate visualization. This code is unorganized and uncommented. Lastly, in the PilotScript folder, the pilot scripts can be seen that was used to research before the main experiments.
